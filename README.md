# Brain Stroke Prediction
## Introduction
The project is about predicting whether a person can have a Brain Stroke in future given his respective features. It is a classification project using Machine Learning. The project contains Data cleaning steps, Pre-processing, Feature engineering, EDA, Model development and Evaluation.

## Data
The Data has been extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zzettrkalpakbal/full-filled-brain-stroke-dataset). 
Data contains various features which impact the which could lead to a stroke such as Age, Hypertension, Heart disease, Working state etc.

## ML Algorithms used
* K-Neighbor Classification
* Random Forest Classification
* Support Vector Machines
